**OpenAI ChatGPT Robot Coding Interface**

This repository provides code for an iterative learning loop where a human collaborates with OpenAI's ChatGPT to code a robot in Python. The main code files are openAIAlchemy.py, main.py, and queryDict.json.

**Introduction**

The aim of this project is to facilitate collaboration between humans and artificial intelligence in coding robotics applications, specifically targeting the LEGO SPIKE Prime platform. By leveraging OpenAI's ChatGPT, users can interactively write code alongside the AI, enabling a streamlined development process and fostering learning opportunities.

**Usage**

To use this repository, follow these steps:
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the required dependencies.
- Execute main.py to start the interactive coding session with OpenAI's ChatGPT.

**File Descriptions**

openAIAlchemy.py: Contains the main class openAIAlchemy, which interfaces with the OpenAI API for communication.
main.py: Orchestrates the interaction between the user, ChatGPT, and the robot coding interface.
queryDict.json: Contains valuable syntax and documentation for MicroPython coding on the LEGO SPIKE Prime platform.
