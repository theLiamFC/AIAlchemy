Task        : Implement a MicroPython script that will continuously read the signal from pin 8, then if a high signal is detected, provide a digital output
openmv_worker: I am querying documentation for machine.pin on openmv
openmv_worker: I am querying documentation for help on openmv
openmv_worker: I am querying documentation for pyb on openmv
openmv_worker: I am querying documentation for pyb.pin on openmv
openmv_worker: I'm having trouble finding documentation for handling input/output on specific pins using MicroPython. Could you please provide some guidance?
CEO: Thank you for the feedback. Openmv worker, to output a high signal on pin 9, you can use `machine.pin(9, machine.Pin.OUT).high()`. Continue working and let me know if you need further assistance. 

Now, let's check pico_worker. Do you have any updates or need any assistance?
=========================== RUNNING CODE (10 second(s)) ===========================
import pyb

while True:
   if pyb.Pin(8, pyb.Pin.IN).value() == 1:
       pyb.Pin(9, pyb.Pin.OUT).high()
================================== SERIAL OUPUT ===================================

======================================= END =======================================
openmv_worker: Could you please verify whether the code correctly outputs a high signal on pin 9 when a high signal is detected on pin 8?
