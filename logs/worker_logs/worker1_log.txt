Serial port : /dev/cu.usbmodem3356396133381
Task        : Please handle the second part of the task and set the Spike Prime to listen for the Bluetooth signal from the Raspberry Pi Pico. When it receives the signal, it will cause one of the motors in ports A or B to wave. You should also have a default position for the motor and a movement pattern that represents "waving".

spike_worker: What is the output after running the code?
MANAGER: The code executed by the spike_worker did not produce any output. Let's have them confirm that the device is correctly listening for Bluetooth signals and that the motor is in the correct initial position. Please ensure that the device is also ready to move the motor in a waving pattern upon receiving the signal. If there are any issues or errors, please let me know so I can assist.
