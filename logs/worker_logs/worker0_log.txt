Task        : Please handle the first part of the task and configure pin 11 on the Raspberry Pi Pico to emit a signal over Bluetooth when it goes high. This signal (ideally a unique identifier or a specific message) should be set up to be sent whenever the state of pin 11 changes to high.

pico_worker: What is the number of Pin 11 in micropython on this microcontroller?
MANAGER: The GPIO (General Purpose Input/Output) number for Pin 11 on the Raspberry Pi Pico is GPIO3 in MicroPython. Please configure GPIO3 (Pin 11) to emit a Bluetooth signal when it goes high. Don't forget to test the Bluetooth signal to make sure it can be detected by other devices. Proceed when you are ready.
